# Adaptive_DNN

This project presents a system capable of detecting replay attacks on automatic speaker verification systems by dynamically recognizing and capturing environmental and device artifacts introduced during replay via filterbanks.

## Requirements

* Python 3.6
* PyTorch 1.8.0
* torch-dct (https://github.com/zh217/torch-dct)
